# Sarissa Architecture

## System Overview

Sarissa is a comprehensive security platform designed for vulnerability assessment and management. The system is built with a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Service (Port 8080)
- Web-based user interface
- Real-time vulnerability dashboard
- User management interface
- Report generation and visualization

### 2. API Service (Port 8081)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- Data processing and analysis
- Integration interfaces

### 3. Database Layer
- PostgreSQL database
- Secure credential storage
- Audit logging
- Data persistence

### 4. Security Components
- Authentication system
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   - User credentials are validated
   - JWT tokens are generated
   - Session management

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Target system scanning
   - Vulnerability detection
   - Risk assessment
   - Report generation

3. **Data Processing**
   - Raw data collection
   - Analysis and correlation
   - Report generation
   - Alert management

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Secure credential storage
- Regular security audits

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- IP-based access restrictions

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging
- Privacy considerations

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- CPU: 2+ cores
- RAM: 4GB minimum
- Storage: 20GB minimum
- Network: 100Mbps minimum

### Software Requirements
- Linux-based operating system
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Rust 1.76+
- Docker (optional)
